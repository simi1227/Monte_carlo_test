# Monte Carlo Simulation & Permutation Demonstration

This repo provides a simple yet effective demonstration of **permutation generation** and **Monte Carlo simulation techniques** for testing and educational purposes.  
It includes examples showing how random permutations can be generated, visualised, and applied to datasets such as OHLCV (Open-High-Low-Close-Volume) market data.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The core of this repository demonstrates:
- Generating random **permutations** from a numeric array as well as complex financial datasets with OHLCV data.
- Performing **Monte Carlo simulations** using permutation methods to evaluate investment performance.
- Plotting or printing permutation results to observe stochastic behavior.

All examples are implemented in Python and demonstrated interactively in the Jupyter Notebook **[`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb)**.
